# Nashville Police Service Call Analysis: Project Overview

Dataset: https://data.nashville.gov/Police/Metro-Nashville-Police-Department-Calls-for-Servic/kwnd-qrrm <br>
Tableau Visualization : https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/michaeljwilt/viz/RamseyProject/NashvillePoliceServiceCalls

# Overview
* Performed cleaning and wrangling of dataset through handling of NA values
* Used lambda functions to split date values to recode them to datetime format
* Perform Exploratory Data Analysis in Python then Tableau for the visualizations

## Conclusions
* Service Calls and Crime Rates are on a donward trend
  - Crime Rate in 2021 was 3rd lowest since 1966
  - Burglary Rates in 2021 were lowest EVER in Davidson and Nashville.
* Focus should be put on adding zone data to all possible service calls
  - This will allow us to provide better staffing for higher risk zones.
    


## Code and Resources Used 
**Python Version:** 3.9.12
**Packages:** pandas  



## EDA
I focused on three elements:
  1. Number of Calls by date & time
  2. Tencode Descriptions for calls
  3. Zones for most frequent service calls


     
## Conclusions
* We do see a downward trend in both service calls and crime rates over time
* The departments past 7 years has done a wonderful job including the lowest Burglary rate in the history of the county <br>

      
* However, there needs to be a better collection of zone data for each service call to allow us to properly staff our areas. This is for not only the safety of the community, but the safety of our officers as well.
